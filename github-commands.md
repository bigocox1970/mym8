## Summary of Changes Made

1. Fixed the sticky header to respect the sidebar width by adding `md:left-64` to the fixed headers
2. Moved the ChatInput component directly inside the Card component for proper alignment
3. Reduced bottom padding from `pb-24` to `pb-4` to eliminate wasted space
4. Added the input as a `flex-shrink-0` element to maintain proper layout
